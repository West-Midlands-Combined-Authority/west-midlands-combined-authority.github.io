    <h2>Power and participation</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p class="igf-cpp">Power and participation are about the extent to which people and have a voice in influencing the things that matter to them. People who feel that they have choice and control over their own personal circumstances, and who feel that they have power to participate and shape the places in which they live and work, will feel a greater sense of belonging and a greater share in the prospects of a place.</p>
    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <p class="igf-cpp">By considering and understanding how people perceive and use their power and influence, communities will have a stake in the success of local places. 
      <br><br>
      Models such as the ‘Ladder of Citizen Participation’ (Sherry Arnstein, 1969), sets out different ways in which people may have a voice about what matters to them. This can include: 
      <br><br>
      informing – giving objective information to tell people about what is happening 
      <br><br>
      consulting – asking for feedback to shape decisions 
      <br><br>
      involving – working with people to ensure that aspirations and concerns are understood 
      <br><br>
      collaborating – co-designing ideas and solutions with people 
      <br><br>
      devolving – placing decision-making in the hands of people and communities to decide what is right for them </p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p class="igf-cpp">People have the power and can fully participate in influencing and exercising agency in the things that matter to them.</p>
    <h3>Metrics</h3>
    <ul class="igf-cpp">
      <li>Overall turnout for local elections</li>
      <li>Civic participation and volunteering</li>
      <li>Trust in local Council and Council tax collection rates</li>
      <li>Uptake of vaccination such as childhood vaccinations</li>
    </ul>
