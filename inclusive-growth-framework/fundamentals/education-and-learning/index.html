      <h1>Inclusive Growth</h1>
      <p>A more deliberate and socially purposeful model of growth, measured not only by how fast or aggressive it is; but also, by how well it is created and shared across the whole population and place, and by the social and environmental outcomes it realises for our people.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p class="igf-el">Education and learning opportunities are important for children and young people to flourish and realise their potential. It is also just as important for working aged and older adults to have purposeful and meaningful lives and careers. Consequently, lifelong learning opportunities to gain new skills, retrain for a new job or simply pursue their own interests for leisure, are important for an inclusive society.</p>
    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <p class="igf-el">For our children and young people, it is worth considering the extent to which they can attend a good or outstanding school, to study the subjects that they want to, and the extent to which their training and the careers advice offered gives them the aspirations, skills, and knowledge to flourish and fully realise their potential. 
      <br><br>
      For working aged and older adults, considerations include the extent to which our education and training is aligned to current and future potential growth sectors and to their interests and aspirations. 
      <br><br>
      These have equality dimensions, for instance, in whether such opportunities are accessible to our diverse communities and whether discrimination and other societal factors limit the potential for people to succeed. </p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p class="igf-el">Improved levels of skills for all to flourish and realise their potential.</p>
    <h3>Metrics</h3>
    <ul class="igf-el">
      <li>Working aged population with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels" title="Qualification Levels">Level 4 qualifications</a> and above</li>
      <li>Young people not in education, employment, or training</li>
      <li>Attainment 8 score (GCSE)</li>
      <li>Pupils reaching the expected standard at the end of key stage 2 in reading, writing and mathematics</li>
    </ul>
