      <h1>Inclusive Growth</h1>
      <p>A more deliberate and socially purposeful model of growth, measured not only by how fast or aggressive it is; but also, by how well it is created and shared across the whole population and place, and by the social and environmental outcomes it realises for our people.</p>

    <h2 class="igf-cr">Climate resilience</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p class="igf-cr">Climate resilience is the capacity to which our social and economic ecosystems can cope with the multiple risks, uncertainty and threats posed by climate change. We can become more resilient to climate change if we work within the planetary limits, or by making adaptations which increase our ability to cope with the risks, uncertainties, and threats. 
      <br><br>
      In effect, our planetary boundaries set an outer limit on growth, and climate resilience is a recognition that growth is unsustainable if natural resources are exploited in a way that exceeds the capacity of the planet to regenerate and replenish itself.</p>
    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <p class="igf-cr">In our climate resilience fundamental, we have highlighted four areas of particular importance to our region: energy use, waste, emissions, and biodiversity.
      <br><br>
      The <a href="https://www.wmca.org.uk/media/4008/wm2041-final-003.pdf" title="WMCA 2041 Strategy">WMCA climate strategy #WM2041</a> sets out our ambition to be net zero by 2041. The strategy emphasises increasing the availability of green and blue spaces, increasing recycling rates and growing the circular economy. Considerations include: 
      <br><br>
      Changing our economy without leaving anyone behind  
      <br><br>
      Investing in the resilience of our places 
      <br><br>
      Using the regionâ€™s industrial past to create a new future  
      <br><br>
      Create places and connections that help us to meet the climate challenge  
      <br><br>
      Decoupling prosperity from the consumption of energy and resources</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p class="igf-cr">Carbon emissions decoupled from economic growth and reduced to net zero by 2041.</p>
    <h3>Metrics</h3>
    <ul class="igf-cr">
      <li>Total carbon emissions</li>
      <li>Carbon emissions per capita</li>
      <li>Household waste sent for reuse, recycling and composting</li>
      <li>Energy use and energy intensity</li>
      <li>Protecting and restoring biodiversity</li>
    </ul>
