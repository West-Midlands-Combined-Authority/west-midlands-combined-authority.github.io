    <h2>Affordable and safe places</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p class="igf-asp">Affordable and safe places is about everyone having decent homes that they can afford, and neighbourhoods where they feel secure, and feel a sense of belonging.</p>
    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <p class="igf-asp">Recognising that different groups of people, for instance, people with low incomes, disabled people, older people, and other vulnerable people have different experiences, further consideration must be given to create spaces, public realm and neighbourhoods that are inclusive and accessible so that everyone can thrive and flourish.</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p class="igf-asp">Designing out homelessness in the West Midlands through prevention by design: affordable supply, tackling welfare related poverty, good employment, information, advice and guidance, and integrated prevention.</p>
    <h3>Metrics</h3>
    <ul class="igf-asp">
      <li>Ratio of median house price to median annual earnings</li>
      <li>Additional affordable homes and vacant dwellings</li>
      <li>Rates of homelessness such as families with children in temporary accommodation</li>
      <li>People killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions</li>
      <li>Crime rates (criminal damage and arson; juvenile first time entrants to the youth justice system [aged 10-17]; violence against the person with injury; domestic violence and abuse)</li>
    </ul>
