      <h1>Inclusive Growth</h1>
      <p>A more deliberate and socially purposeful model of growth, measured not only by how fast or aggressive it is; but also, by how well it is created and shared across the whole population and place, and by the social and environmental outcomes it realises for our people.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p class="igf-cie">An inclusive economy is one where everyone has a stake and is fully included in the process of growing a flourishing and sustainable economy, instead of one where a small number of people benefit first, and then wealth is redistributed later or trickled down.</p>
    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <p class="igf-cie">For growth to be inclusive, interventions in investment and policy must improve living standards for everyone, leaving nobody behind. 
      <br><br>
      It is important to consider all elements of the economy. For example, strengthening smaller businesses and social enterprises in local areas increases the vibrancy of our local places and encourages pride in place.  This also improves the ability of local areas to stay resilient when faced with external shocks which adversely impact the economy.  
      <br><br>
      Investments that increase and sustain future spending power in a local area help to nurture improvements beyond the initial investment period. By making sure that businesses and organisations pay a real living wage, growth is equitable and community wealth accrues.</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p class="igf-cie">People experience an increase in their household incomes and a better standard of living.</p>
    <h3>Metrics</h3>
    <ul class="igf-cie">
      <li>Gross Disposable Household Income per head of population at current basic rates</li>
      <li>Youth claimant rates as a % proportion of 16-24 year olds in the WMCA area.</li>
      <li>GDP per capita in the WMCA area</li>
      <li>Proportion of employee jobs below Living Wage in the region</li>
      <li>Average turnover for a social enterprise in the West Midlands</li>
    </ul>
