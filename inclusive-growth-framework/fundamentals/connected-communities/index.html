    <h2>Connected communities</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p class="igf-cc">Connected communities are about the extent to which people can interact with the world around them. This includes both physical connectivity, in terms of people having quick and reliable transport connections to reach places where they can live, work, play, and meet each other; as well as digital connectivity and inclusion.</p>
    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <p class="igf-cc">Not everyone has access to a car, in particular, people on low incomes. Therefore, ensuring that all communities in our region are better connected through quick and reliable public transport such as buses, and active travel infrastructures such as walking and cycling, are essential for many people in accessing local amenities and opportunities. Consideration must also be given to connectivity for disabled people so that they too can fully participate and access places to live, work and play. 
      <br><br>
      With much of modern life happening online, digital connectivity and inclusion is just as important as physical connectivity. Consideration must be given to ensure communities have access to affordable, quick and reliable broadband internet access; and consideration must also be given to building in digital inclusion, so that all citizens, including older people and people on low incomes, can be active participants in the digital sphere. </p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p class="igf-cc">People live in connected communities which enable everyone to interact with the world around them, both physically and digitally.</p>
    <h3>Metrics</h3>
    <ul class="igf-cc">
      <li>Access (and barriers) to housing, transport, and services</li>
      <li>Adults who are active (activity of moderate intensity of at least 150+ minutes per week)</li>
      <li>Digital inclusion / risk of digital exclusion</li>
      <li>Gigabit broadband internet connectivity</li>
    </ul>
