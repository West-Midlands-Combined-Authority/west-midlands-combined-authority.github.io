    <h1>Inclusive Growth</h1>
    <p>A more deliberate and socially purposeful model of growth, measured not only by how fast or aggressive it is; but also, by how well it is created and shared across the whole population and place, and by the social and environmental outcomes it realises for our people.</p>

    <h2>Inclusive Growth Framework Fundamentals</h2>
    <h3>The Inclusive Growth Doughnut</h3>
    <iframe id="doughnut-iframe" src="/inclusive-growth-framework/doughnut/"></iframe>
    <p>The inclusive growth doughnut proposes that our economy is only fit-for-purpose if it meets the needs and aspirations of people whilst being regenerative of the environment. It is made up of:</p>
    <p>Seven human-focused fundamentals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_top" title="Inclusive economy" class="igf-link" href="/inclusive-growth-framework/fundamentals/inclusive-economy/">Inclusive economy</a></li>
      <li><a target="_top" title="Power and participation" class="igf-link" href="/inclusive-growth-framework/fundamentals/power-and-participation/">Power and participation</a></li>
      <li><a target="_top" title="Affordable and safe places" class="igf-link" href="/inclusive-growth-framework/fundamentals/affordable-and-safe-places/">Affordable and safe places</a></li>
      <li><a target="_top" title="Connected communities" class="igf-link" href="/inclusive-growth-framework/fundamentals/connected-communities/">Connected communities</a></li>
      <li><a target="_top" title="Education and learning" class="igf-link" href="/inclusive-growth-framework/fundamentals/education-and-learning/">Education and learning</a></li>
      <li><a target="_top" title="Health and wellbeing" class="igf-link" href="/inclusive-growth-framework/fundamentals/health-and-wellbeing/">Health and wellbeing</a></li>
      <li><a target="_top" title="Equality" class="igf-link" href="/inclusive-growth-framework/fundamentals/equality/">Equality</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>And one fundamental focused on planetary boundaries:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_top" title="Climate resilience" class="igf-link" href="/inclusive-growth-framework/fundamentals/climate-resilience/">Climate resilience</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How the framework is structured</h2>
    <p>The eight fundamentals are set out as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>summary</strong> – a description of the fundamental</li>
      <li><strong>considerations</strong> – how the fundamental can be embedded and put into practice</li>
      <li><strong>outcomes</strong> – bellwether outcome on what success looks like</li>
      <li><strong>metrics</strong> – a headline metric alongside a range of supporting metrics</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="overshoot-and-shortfall">Overshoot and shortfall</h3>
    <p>The fundamental focused on the planetary boundaries – climate resilience – is in tension with the other seven: if we are overshooting planetary boundaries, it means the things we are doing to meet human needs will ultimately undermine the planetary ecosystem that allows them to thrive, and as such, need to change. The counterfactual is also true – it is possible to bring ourselves within planetary limits in a way which does harm to people; that also needs to be avoided.</p>
    <p>This tension – and the tensions between the seven human-focused fundamentals – are a helpful guide to how we can create inclusive growth. For example, knowing that people living in poverty are also using the least carbon shows people making policies and investments associated with carbon reduction that they need to address the poverty alongside that effort, as they will otherwise risk worsening that poverty.</p>
